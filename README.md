# Jordanian_coffee_order

Using the power of TensorFlow and CV2, this project offers an easy-to-implement solution for detecting and interpreting Jordanian drive-thru signs in real-time. Developed as a passion project, it showcases the accessibility and simplicity of implementing computer vision and machine learning techniques.

While this project was initially pursued for personal enjoyment, it has the potential to make a significant impact in enhancing inclusivity and convenience for customers, especially those with hearing impairments or a preference for non-verbal communication. By automating the recognition of Jordanian drive-thru signs, we create an environment where everyone can participate independently and effortlessly.
